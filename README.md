IBMÂ® Mobile Push Notification provides a simple way to integrate Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) with your iOS (iPhone & iPad) 7.0 and above applications.

The IBM Push Notification SDK for Apple iOS provides application publishers with APNS registration, mobile app message handling and display, and inbox and in-app message support.

You can also use the Apple Watch Plugin for wearable support to use with your iOS mobile app messages. Documentation for the Apple Watch Plugin is available in [IBM Knowledge Center](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSMRK7_3.0.0/AppPush/Apple_iOS/applewatch.dita).

For more information about implementing the SDK and building your mobile app messages, see the iOS documentation in [IBM Knowledge Center](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSMRK7_3.0.0/AppPush/ios_container.dita).
